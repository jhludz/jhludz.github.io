          <p>Associate Salesforce Administrator in Fort Washington: Finding work during the COVID pandemic required me to continue building technical skills. I earned my Salesforce
              201 certification and landed an admin/developer role at Coventry Resources LLC. This role demanded that I complete routine Salesforce duties, like adding and freezing users, as well
              as more advanced duties, like developing new automation (process builders, lightning flows, custom lightning components)
              and rigerously testing that automation before releasing it to our Test Sandbox for UAT. Experience and highlights listed below.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Testing experience</b>
                   <ul>
                       <li><b>User Acceptance Testing (UAT):</b> Both released updates to users and reviewed results, as well as tested code from outside developers and reported on integration compatability.</li>
                       <li><b>Alpha Testing:</b> Rigorously tested software that I designed within my Development Sandbox to expose all bugs, design issues, business concerns, etc.</li>
                       <li><b>Monkey Testing/Data Quality Testing:</b> Can the system branch, or automation be crashed when input fields recieve bad or nonsensical data.</li>
                       <li><b>Unit Testing:</b> Tested updates in a clean environemtn, where I could verify the new process worked without worrying about compatability with other automation/system constraints.</li>
                       <li><b>Regression Testing: </b> Tested to see what existing automation and processes were affected/disrupted by the updates after unit testing.</li>
                       <li><b>Automated Testing:</b> Used Postman to run automated tests on Salesforce automation.</li>
                   </ul>
              <br>
                   <b>Key Duties</b>
                  <ul>
                      <li><b>Salesforce Chat:</b> Developed, tested, and released Salesforce Chat to the company's Direct to Consumer (DTC) business unit. This sunsetted the SnapEngage tool that ran outside of the Salesforce environment and brought new, consolidated, and actionable data to our business users.</li>
                      <li><b>Outlook Integration:</b> Rigerously tested the change set developed by external specialists, which was enabling our users to log emails from Outlook and Microsoft 360  as tasks in Salesforce.</li>
                      <li><b>User Access:</b> Added users and editted existing users to either limit or expand access/visibility in Salesforce.</li>
                      <li><b>Reporting:</b> Created Salesforce Reports and Dashboards for Users upo request.</li>
                      <li><b>Ticketing Platform:</b> Kept my JIRA ticket dashboard clean and up to date to ensure work kept moving.</li>
                  </ul>

          <p>Shopping & Feed Coordinator Trainee at Tinuiti in Philadelphia: In 2020 I moved into digital marketing and began a working at Tinuiti.
              I developed expertise in the following UIs: Search Ads 360 (SA360), Google Shopping Ads, Google Merchant Center Google Analytics, Google Adwords Editor, Bing Ads, Kenshoo, Feedonomics, Wrike, and Supermetrics.
              Using these tools, I supported accounts with monthly spend upwards of $100,000. I managed daily search term bid adjustments/optimizations 
              to eliminate poor performing search queries and grow ROAS on high performers. I pulled weekly SQRs to eliminate problematic search trends from campaigns,
              and updated the Shopping account pacing documents/logs and generated custom reporting to inform clients on account performance on a weekly basis.

          <p>Operations Manager at VeryApt in Philadelphia: At VeryApt, I managed engaged user growth through aggregating disparate housing data to inform/facilitate apartment searches.
             I managed anage a team of realtors at a tech enabled brokerage that received traffic anywhere from 60-600 unique users per month depending on seasonality. My job is to teach others how to leverage our aggregation tools (proprietary CRM) in order to maintain a +10% team monetization rate on traffic, regardless of volume.
             I have extensive experience in reporting to management with data visualizations that aid in defining and troubleshooting business process issues.
             I also owned  listing agreement creation which was responsible for 10% increase YoY growth in the concierge sector of our business.

          <p>I have been a champion of Agile/Scrum in the role of product owner in an educational setting (working alongside a full-stack developer) to deliver a form submission web app that became the University of Delaware Hospitality Department's primary method of tracking required student participation. Making sure that our two man engineer team received well-defined work and that the Daily Scrum stayed within the scope of Sprint goals/planning was my primary task. This resulted in the timely delivery of a web-based tool that was fully integrated with the University's Central Authentication Service (CAS) and has replaced the paper and pencil tracking system used beforehand. The system even outputs a dynamic standard report dashboard that can be adjusted to show aggregate student service progress, of be filtered by individual students.</p>
